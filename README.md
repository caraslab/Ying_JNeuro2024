# Supporting code for Ying et al., 2024 JNeuro
Raw data were preprocessed using MatLab and the pipelines listed below.

## Workflow

1. Raw data collection with MatLab (ePsych) and Intan/Synapse software

2. Data preprocessing with MatLab:
    - [Behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-behavior-analysis)
    - [EPhys + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-spikesortingKS2)

3. Data processing with MatLab:
    - [ePsych Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/caraslab/epa)
    - Session Pipeline (in current repository)
4. Data and statistical analysis with Matlab/R:
    - Analysis Pipeline (in current repository)
    - glm_models.R (in current repository)

## Data repository
1. Preprocessed data (EPhys spike and behavioral timestamps) can be downloaded from [UMD DRUM]
