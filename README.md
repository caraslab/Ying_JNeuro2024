# Supporting code for Ying et al., 2024 JNeuro
Raw data were preprocessed using our MatLab and pipelines listed below.

## Workflow

1. Raw data collection with MatLab (ePsych) and Intan/Synapse software

2. Data preprocessing with MatLab:
    - [Behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-behavior-analysis)
    - [EPhys + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/caraslab-spikesortingKS2)

3. Data processing and plotting with MatLab:
    - [EPhys + behavior](https://github.com/caraslab/Caraslab_EPhys_preprocessing_pipeline)
    - [ePsych Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/caraslab/epa)

4. Data analysis and plotting with R pipeline (current repository)

## Data repository
1. Preprocessed data (EPhys spike timestamps, photometry raw signals, behavioral timestamps) can be downloaded from [UMD DRUM]
